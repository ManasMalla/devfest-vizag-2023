Through my company GURUJADA, we are trying to help teachers teach better and learners learn better on the online medium. Community: The developer ecosystem in Vizag is young, curious and sincere. While there are a lot of talented students from the technology colleges and universities around, the number of professionals from around the state interested in community learning and latest tools are steadily increasing.
